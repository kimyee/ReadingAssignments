Questions:
1. When defining a method, when no return keyword is specified, what is the return value?

 If no return keyword is specified, the object created by the last line in the method is automatically treated as the return value.


2. What happens when you call the "return" keyword in the middle of a method?

Calling return exits the method at that point. No code in the method after the return statement is executed.


3. What method do you define to pass parameters into a new object?

instance method


4. How do you define a class method?

class Foo
  def self.bar
    puts "class method"
  end
end

Foo.bar


5. How would you write attr_accessor, attr_reader, and attr_writer by hand?

class Person
  def name
    @name
  end

  def name =(str)
    @name = str
  end
end

person = Person.new
person.name = "Kim"
person.name
